- **Node.js**: After installing Homebrew, go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version of Node.js.

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (for downloading the project from GitHub)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for editing code)
  
#### 2. Clone the Repository

1. Open **GitHub Desktop** and sign in to your GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Go to the repository page on GitHub and click **Code** > **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
3. In GitHub Desktop, choose the directory where you'd like to save the project and click **Clone**.
   
   Once the repository is downloaded, you'll see it listed in GitHub Desktop.

#### 3. Open in VS Code

# Deploying Valueform 2.0 on Vercel

### Introduction
This guide will help you deploy the **Valueform 2.0** project on Vercel, including instructions for staging changes and managing production deployments. You can test changes in a **staging environment** before pushing them live in production.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup).
- The **Valueform 2.0** project set up in a GitHub repository.
- Vercel linked to your GitHub account.

---

### 1. Setting Up Your Project in Vercel (Production)

#### Step 1: Connect Vercel to GitHub
1. Log in to your Vercel account and navigate to your **Dashboard**.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Choose **Import Git Repository** and select your **Valueform 2.0** repository from GitHub.
4. Once selected, Vercel will guide you through the setup.
   - **Root Directory**: Set to `/pages`.
   - Build and output settings should be left as default (Vercel will auto-detect these).
5. After completing the setup, Vercel will automatically deploy the `main` branch as your **Production** site. The site URL will be provided after the deployment.

#### Step 2: Managing Production Deployments
1. Whenever changes are made and merged into the `main` branch in GitHub, Vercel will automatically trigger a new **production deployment**.
2. Simply push your changes to the `main` branch in GitHub, and Vercel will handle the rest.

---

### 2. Creating a Staging Environment (For Testing)

#### Step 1: Creating a New Branch in GitHub for Staging
1. In **GitHub**, create a new branch to test changes (you can create this via GitHub's web interface or in your GitHub Desktop app).
   - Example: `staging-feature-branch`.

2. Make your edits on this branch and push it to GitHub.

#### Step 2: Setting Up a Staging Deployment on Vercel

1. Go to your **GitHub Dashboard**.
2. Click on your project **Valueform 2.0**.
3. Go to **Settings** for the project.
4. Click the **Git** tab to configure deployment hooks.
5. In the **Deploy Hooks** section, type the name of the branch you want to use for staging twice (e.g., `staging-feature-branch`).
6. Click **Create Hook**.
7. Copy the hook URL generated for this branch.

#### Step 3: Using the Deploy Hook in VS Code

1. In **VS Code**, open the terminal for the project.
2. Run the following command to trigger a deployment for the staging branch. Be sure to replace the placeholder with the copied hook URL:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST <your-copied-hook-url>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_98g22o5YUFVHlKOzj9vKPTyN2SDG/tKybBxqhQs
   ```

3. Once the command is run, your staging branch will be deployed to Vercel.

#### Step 4: Monitoring and Testing the Staging Deployment

1. Go to the **Vercel Dashboard**.
2. Click on your project **Valueform 2.0**.
3. Navigate to the **Deployments** tab.
4. Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the staging deployment and select **Create Deployment**.
5. In the **Create Deployment** modal, select the branch you deployed (e.g., `staging-feature-branch`) and click **Create Deployment**.

After completing these steps, you can visit the preview URL provided by Vercel to test your staging deployment.

---

### 3. Deploying Staging Changes to Production

Once your changes have been tested in staging and are ready to go live:

1. Go to GitHub and create a **Pull Request** to merge the staging branch into `main`.
2. Once the Pull Request is approved and merged, Vercel will automatically trigger a **Production Deployment**.
3. The live site will be updated to reflect your latest changes.

---

### 4. Monitoring Deployments in Vercel

You can monitor all your deployments from the Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to your project in the Vercel Dashboard.
- Under the **Deployments** tab, you will see the status of each branch (production or preview).
- You can roll back or redeploy from the interface if needed.

---

This approach allows you to stage changes, test thoroughly, and then seamlessly deploy to production, all through Vercelâ€™s web interface.
