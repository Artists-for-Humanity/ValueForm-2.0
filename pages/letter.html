                    <p class="text-m">
                        Previously, agencies and consultancies full of designers tackled business challenges with
                        creative thinking. They were valued for bringing fresh and diverse perspectives. These
                        collaborations led to remarkable outcomes. The thousands of:

                    <p class="text-m bold"> - Hours of engagement delivered by Nike Fuel,</p>
                    <p class="text-m bold"> - Direct users and their data brought to HBO GO,</p>
                    <p class="text-m bold"> - Minutes saved by Disney's Magic Band</p>


                    </p>
                    <p class="text-m"> And the millions in revenue they generated were all made in partnership with
                        agencies and consultancies.</p>

                    <p class="text-m">
                        But now, I can't find those kinds of results. Agents no longer drive outcomes for brands. The
                        role of creative partners has shifted. Agencies and consultancies lost their ability and
                        consequently, permission to help businesses leapfrog their competitors. I plan on taking it
                        back.
                        Today, most firms fall into two categories:
                    <p class="text-m"><span class="bold">The Production Shop:</span> When brands lack in-house teams,
                        firms function as production units or staff augmentation. They follow orders, but novel thinking
                        is absent. Soon you won't need these firms. With the rise of Al development and design tools,
                        production and execution will become cheap and easy.</p>
                    <p class="text-m"> <span class="bold">Change Champions (not agents):</span> When businesses face big
                        challenges, firms create overly grand solutions that prove nearly impossible to implement. It's
                        "innovation theater," involving navel-gazing, visionary north-star initiatives showcased through
                        non-committal slide decks. It's hard to measure the value of this work - at best, it inspires,
                        and at worst, it's a waste of time and money.</p>

                        Neither of these alone delivers business outcomes, and they rarely work together or originate
                        from the same firm. There's a gap in the way things are done.The model is disjointed and broken.
                        Value needs to be formed. And we won't get there by following orders blindly or cheering from
                        the sidelines.
